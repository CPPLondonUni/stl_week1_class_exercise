# Introductory STL Exercise #

(*Note: this exercise uses `NanoRange`, a library that implements some
new C++20 facilities. This is purely to make the syntax a bit simpler: all
of these exercises could be done using the standard library as well.)*

cppreference.com provides a [detailed guide](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm)
to all the standard library algorithms.

# Exercise 1 #

The function `get_words()` from header `words.hpp` returns a list of random
English words.

Can you print these out in alphabetical order?

# Exercise 2 #

The function `get_random_numbers()` from header `random_numbers.hpp` returns
a list of 100 random numbers in the range [1, 1000]. 

 * What are the minimum and maximum values you were given?
 * [Harder] what is the *median* of the values you were given?
